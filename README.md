# CSCA20
CSCA20 Project
The project is a text turn based game similar to Pokemon where the user picks one of 2 or more initial characters each with different attributes (strength, defence, health etc.) they then fight by choosing one of 4 attacks which will be 2 attacks (one high damage attack low accuracy, and one low damage high accuracy) one increases strength, one  increases strength, one decreases the opponent's strength and one decreases their defence. The damage done will be randomly chosen from a range. The different character will have 4 of the 6 above attacks. After the character defeats the opponent they will have the option to add it to their party. Then they will encounter another character and fight them. The user will encounter up to 4 or 5 opponents in increasing difficulty,  and if they defeat all of them they will have won. There is a random encounter where the character has the option to skip to the final boss.
